## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18.0 or higher)
* npm (or yarn/pnpm)
* A MongoDB connection string (you can get a free one at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/aryan55254/tasks-track.git](https://github.com/aryan55254/tasks-track.git)
    cd tasks-track
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    * Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies.
        ```sh
        cd backend
        npm install
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following variables:
        ```env
        # Get this from your MongoDB Atlas connection string
        MONGO_URL="your-mongodb-connection-string"

        # Generate a secret using `openssl rand -base64 32` in your terminal
        JWT_SECRET="your-strong-jwt-secret"

        NODE_ENV=development
        ```
    * Start the backend server (it will typically run on port 3000):
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    * Open a **new terminal window** and navigate to the frontend directory.
        ```sh
        # From the root project directory:
        cd frontend
        npm install
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add the following variable. This tells your frontend where the backend API is running.
        ```env
        # For local development, point this to your running local backend server
        VITE_BACKEND_API="http://localhost:3000"
        ```    
    * Start the frontend development server (it will typically run on port 5173):
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```

4.  **You're all set!**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever port your Vite server indicates) to see the application in action! The frontend will connect to your local backend server.
